## Scenario: Getting Recommendations When Things Get Confusing

### Your Goal
You want advice on which product to buy. But the employee might: give an answer you can't understand, recommend something way too expensive, not know the answer, or ask you questions you can't follow.

### Setting
You're in a Polish supermarket looking at two or more options. You want help choosing. What could go wrong?

---

## Complication 1: You Can't Understand Their Recommendation

**You asked for advice. They gave a long answer you couldn't follow.**

**You:** Który jest lepszy? `(KTOO-rih yest LEP-shih)` - Which is better?

**Employee:** *Rapid Polish explaining differences in quality, origin, ingredients, price...*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Ask for simpler answer:**
- **You:** Przepraszam, który? Ten czy ten? `(psheh-PRA-sham, KTOO-rih? ten chih ten)` - Sorry, which one? This or this?
- **Employee:** *Points at one*

**Option B - Ask them to slow down:**
- **You:** Wolniej, proszę. `(VOL-nyey, PRO-sheh)` - Slower, please.

**Option C - Just pick based on their pointing:**
- Watch where they point
- **You:** Ten? `(ten)` - This one?
- Take whichever they indicate

**Option D - Give up and pick randomly:**
- **You:** Dobrze, wezmę ten. Dziękuję. `(DOB-zheh, VEZ-meh ten. jen-KOO-yeh)` - Okay, I'll take this one. Thanks.

---

## Complication 2: They Ask Follow-Up Questions You Don't Understand

**Employee asks about your preferences, but you're lost.**

**You:** Co pan/pani poleca? `(tso pan/PA-nee po-LEH-tsa)` - What do you recommend?

**Employee:** Na co? Na sałatkę? Do gotowania? `(na tso? na sa-WAT-keh? do go-to-VA-nya)` - For what? For salad? For cooking?

**You don't understand "sałatkę" or "gotowania."**

**Your options:**

**Option A - Give simple answer:**
- **You:** Do jedzenia. `(do yeh-DZEN-ya)` - For eating.
- *Generic but works*

**Option B - Just point:**
- **You:** Ten. Dobry? `(ten. DOB-rih)` - This one. Good?

**Option C - Admit you don't understand:**
- **You:** Nie rozumiem. Który jest dobry? `(nyeh ro-ZOO-myem. KTOO-rih yest DOB-rih)` - I don't understand. Which is good?

---

## Complication 3: They Recommend Something Much More Expensive

**You wanted budget advice. They pointed you to premium.**

**You:** Który jest lepszy? `(KTOO-rih yest LEP-shih)` - Which is better?

**Employee:** Ten jest najlepszy! `(ten yest nay-LEP-shih)` - This one is best!
*Points to product 3x more expensive*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Ask for cheaper option:**
- **You:** A coś tańszego? `(a tsosh TAN-sheh-go)` - And something cheaper?

**Option B - Ask about the original options:**
- **You:** A między tymi dwoma? `(a MYEN-dzih TIH-mee DVO-ma)` - And between these two?

**Option C - Accept but don't buy:**
- **You:** Dziękuję. `(jen-KOO-yeh)` - Thank you.
- *Put it back when they leave*

---

## Complication 4: They Don't Know and Guess Anyway

**Employee clearly doesn't know but doesn't admit it.**

**You:** Który jogurt jest najświeższy? `(KTOO-rih YO-goort yest nay-SHVYEZH-shih)` - Which yogurt is freshest?

**Employee:** *Shrugs, points randomly* Ten. `(ten)` - This one.

**You suspect they're guessing.**

**Your options:**

**Option A - Check yourself:**
- **You:** Dziękuję. `(jen-KOO-yeh)` - Thank you.
- Check expiration dates yourself

**Option B - Ask someone else:**
- **You:** Może zapytam kogoś innego. Dziękuję. `(MO-zheh za-PIH-tam KO-gosh EEN-ne-go. jen-KOO-yeh)` - Maybe I'll ask someone else. Thanks.

**Option C - Ask specific question:**
- **You:** Gdzie jest data? `(gjeh yest DA-ta)` - Where is the date?
- *Point to label*

---

## Complication 5: They Go Find Someone Else

**Your question is too hard. They need to find another employee.**

**Employee:** Chwileczkę, zapytam. `(hvee-LECH-keh, za-PIH-tam)` - One moment, I'll ask.
*Walks away*

**What to do:**

**Option A - Wait:**
- Stay where you are
- They may or may not come back

**Option B - Follow them:**
- Keep them in sight
- Approach when they find help

**Option C - Give up:**
- If they're gone too long, make your own choice
- Or ask someone else

---

## Complication 6: They Speak Too Fast Even After You Ask Them to Slow Down

**You asked for slower speech. They slowed down for one sentence, then sped up again.**

**You:** Wolniej, proszę. `(VOL-nyey, PRO-sheh)` - Slower, please.

**Employee:** *Speaks slower* Ten jest dobry. *Speeds up again* Bo jest z lokalnej farmy i ma lepsze składniki i...

**Your survival:**

**Option A - Focus on key words:**
- Listen for "dobry" (good), "lepszy" (better), "ten" (this one)
- **You:** Więc ten? `(vyents ten)` - So this one?

**Option B - Ask yes/no question:**
- **You:** Ten jest dobry? Tak czy nie? `(ten yest DOB-rih? tak chih nyeh)` - This one is good? Yes or no?

**Option C - Just accept:**
- **You:** Dobrze, dziękuję. `(DOB-zheh, jen-KOO-yeh)` - Okay, thanks.
- Take whatever they pointed at

---

## Complication 7: They Recommend Their Personal Favorite (Not What You Asked)

**You asked about two products. They recommend a third they personally like.**

**You:** Który? A czy B? `(KTOO-rih? a chih b)` - Which one? A or B?

**Employee:** Ja zawsze kupuję C. `(ya ZAV-sheh koo-POO-yeh c)` - I always buy C.
*Shows you completely different product*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Accept their suggestion:**
- **You:** Dobrze, wezmę ten. `(DOB-zheh, VEZ-meh ten)` - Okay, I'll take this one.

**Option B - Return to your question:**
- **You:** A między A i B? `(a MYEN-dzih a ee b)` - And between A and B?

**Option C - Politely decline:**
- **You:** Dziękuję, ale wolę te. `(jen-KOO-yeh, ALE VO-leh teh)` - Thanks, but I prefer these.

- **"Nie wiem" is rare**: Polish employees often feel pressure to answer even if they don't know. Watch for confident-sounding guesses.
