## Scenario: Finding Special Diet Products When It Gets Complicated

### Your Goal
You need gluten-free, lactose-free, vegan, or allergy-safe products. But the employee might not understand what you need, might give wrong information, or the section might not exist. Learn to navigate these complications.

### Setting
You're in a Polish supermarket looking for products that meet your dietary requirements. You need to ask for help, but help isn't always helpful.

## Complication 1: Employee Doesn't Know What "Gluten-Free" Means

**You ask for gluten-free products. They look confused.**

**You:** Przepraszam, gdzie są produkty bezglutenowe? `(psheh-PRA-sham, gjeh song pro-DOOK-tih bez-gloo-te-NO-veh)` - Excuse me, where are gluten-free products?

**Employee:** Bez... co? `(bez... tso)` - Without... what?
**Employee:** Nie rozumiem. `(nyeh ro-ZOO-myem)` - I don't understand.

**Your options:**

**Option A - Explain differently:**
- **You:** Bez glutenu. Bez mąki. `(bez GLOO-te-noo. bez MON-kee)` - Without gluten. Without flour.
- **You:** Dla alergików. `(dla a-ler-GEE-koof)` - For people with allergies.

## Complication 2: Employee Gives Confidently Wrong Information

**They point you somewhere, but it's wrong.**

**Employee:** Tam, przy mące. `(tam, pshih MON-tse)` - There, by the flour.
*You go there. It's regular flour. Not gluten-free.*

**What to do:**

## Complication 4: Product Label Is Confusing

**You found something that might be okay, but the label is confusing.**

**Label says:** "Może zawierać śladowe ilości glutenu" `(MO-zheh za-VYEH-rach shla-DO-veh ee-LOSH-chee GLOO-te-noo)` - May contain traces of gluten.

**You're not sure if it's safe:**

**Option A - Ask employee:**
- **You:** Przepraszam, czy to jest bezpieczne dla alergika? `(psheh-PRA-sham, chih to yest bez-PYECH-neh dla a-ler-GEE-ka)` - Sorry, is this safe for someone with allergies?

- Look for crossed grain symbol (gluten-free certified)
- "Bezglutenowe" clearly marked

**Option C - Don't risk it:**

**You:** Czy to zawiera orzechy? `(chih to za-VYEH-ra o-ZHE-hih)` - Does this contain nuts?

**Employee:** Jakie orzechy? Ziemne? Laskowe? `(YA-kyeh o-ZHE-hih? JYEM-neh? las-KO-veh)` - What nuts? Peanuts? Hazelnuts?

**If you don't understand the types:**

- **EU labeling law helps**: All allergens must be in bold on ingredient lists - learn to spot them.
- **Polish brands exist**: Look for brands like "Incola" (gluten-free) or "Alpro" (plant-based).
- **Pharmacy alternative**: Some dietary supplements and specialty foods are in pharmacies (apteka).
- **Employee knowledge varies**: Some are very helpful, others don't know. Don't take it personally.
