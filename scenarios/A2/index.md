## Tips for A2 Learners

1. **Complications are the MAIN content**: Every scenario focuses on what to do when things go wrong
2. **Have exit strategies**: Learn phrases like "Muszę iść" (I have to go) and "Przepraszam że przerywam" (Sorry to interrupt)
3. **Set boundaries politely**: "Dziękuję za troskę" (Thanks for the concern) ends discussions gracefully
4. **Don't justify**: You don't owe explanations for personal decisions
5. **Cultural awareness**: Pay attention to cultural notes - they help you navigate Polish expectations
