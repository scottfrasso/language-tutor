## Scenario: Asking Prices When Communication Fails

### Your Goal
You need to ask the price of something. The problem: the employee might not understand your pronunciation, might give you an answer you can't follow, or might be too busy to help. Learn to handle all these situations.

### Setting
You're in a Polish supermarket holding a product without a clear price tag. You need to find out how much it costs, but this won't always go smoothly.

---

## The Basic Question

**You:** Przepraszam. Ile to kosztuje? `(psheh-PRA-sham. EE-leh to kosh-TOO-yeh)` - Excuse me. How much does this cost?

**Alternative:**
- Ile kosztuje? `(EE-leh kosh-TOO-yeh)` - How much?
- Jaka cena? `(YA-ka TSE-na)` - What's the price?

---

## Complication 1: They Don't Understand You

**Your pronunciation doesn't land. They look confused.**

**Employee:** Słucham? `(SWOO-ham)` - What? / I'm listening?
**Employee:** Co proszę? `(tso PRO-sheh)` - What, please? / Sorry?
**Employee:** Nie rozumiem. `(nyeh ro-ZOO-myem)` - I don't understand.

**Your options:**

**Option A - Try again slower:**
- **You:** *Point at item* Ile... kosztuje... to? `(EE-leh... kosh-TOO-yeh... to)`
- *Speak slowly, point clearly*

**Option B - Just point and ask "how much":**
- **You:** *Hold up item* Ile? `(EE-leh)` - How much?
- *Sometimes simpler is better*

**Option C - Show what you mean:**
- **You:** *Point at item, then at price tags, shrug*
- **Employee:** *Usually gets the idea*

**Option D - Show your phone:**
- **You:** *Show Google Translate or a picture*
- **Employee:** *Understands*

## Complication 2: You Don't Understand Their Answer

**They say a number. You have no idea what it was.**

**Employee:** *mumbles something quickly*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Ask for repetition:**
- **You:** Przepraszam? `(psheh-PRA-sham)` - Sorry?
- **You:** Jeszcze raz? `(YESH-cheh raz)` - One more time?

**Option B - Ask them to speak slower:**
- **You:** Wolniej proszę. `(VOL-nyey PRO-sheh)` - Slower please.

**Option C - Say you don't understand:**
- **You:** Nie rozumiem. `(nyeh ro-ZOO-myem)` - I don't understand.
- *They might write it down or show fingers*

**Option D - Ask them to write it:**
- **You:** Proszę napisać? `(PRO-sheh na-PEE-sach)` - Please write?
- *Point at their hand or a piece of paper*

**Option E - Just look at their hand gesture:**
- *Many Poles will hold up fingers for small numbers*
- *5 fingers = 5 złoty*

## Complication 3: The Employee Seems Annoyed/Busy

**They're clearly busy or irritated. What do you do?**

**Signs they're busy:**
- They sigh
- They barely look at you
- They answer in one word
- They keep working while talking

**Your best approach:**

**Be polite but brief:**
- **You:** Przepraszam, szybkie pytanie. Ile to? `(psheh-PRA-sham, SHIHP-kyeh pih-TA-nyeh. EE-leh to)` - Sorry, quick question. How much?
- *Keep it short, point clearly*

**If they don't know or won't help:**
- **Employee:** Nie wiem. `(nyeh vyem)` - I don't know.
- **Employee:** Przy kasie. `(pshih KA-sheh)` - At the register.
- **You:** Dobrze, dziękuję. `(DOB-zheh, jen-KOO-yeh)` - Okay, thanks.

**Don't take it personally:**
- This isn't about you
- They might be having a bad day
- Find another employee or just go to the register

## Complication 4: The Price Tag Is Wrong or Missing

**You see a price, but it doesn't match what they say.**

**Scenario: You expected 5 zł but they say 15 zł**

**You:** Ale... tu pisze pięć złotych? `(A-le... too PEE-sheh pyench ZWO-tih)` - But... here it says five złoty?
**You:** *Point at the shelf label*

**Employee responses:**
- **Employee:** To inna cena. `(to EEN-na TSE-na)` - That's a different price.
- **Employee:** To za tamten produkt. `(to za TAM-ten pro-DOOKT)` - That's for that product. *points to different item*
- **Employee:** Sprawdzę. `(SPRAV-dzeh)` - I'll check.

**If you think it's wrong:**
- **You:** Może pomyłka? `(MO-zheh po-MIW-ka)` - Maybe a mistake?
- *Cashiers can often verify and honor the lower price*

**At the register:**
- **You:** Myślałem, że to kosztuje pięć złotych. `(mih-SHA-wem zheh to kosh-TOO-ye pyench ZWO-tih)` - I thought this cost five złoty.
- **Cashier:** *may check or honor the lower price*

---

## Complication 5: They Point But You Still Don't Understand

**Employee says "tam" (there) and points vaguely.**

**Employee:** Cena jest tam. `(TSE-na yest tam)` - The price is there. *waves hand*

**You don't see it.**

**Your options:**

**Option A - Admit you can't find it:**
- **You:** Nie widzę. `(nyeh VEE-dzeh)` - I don't see [it].
- **You:** Gdzie dokładnie? `(gjeh do-KWAD-nyeh)` - Where exactly?

**Option B - Ask them to show you:**
- **You:** Proszę pokazać? `(PRO-sheh po-KA-zach)` - Please show [me]?

**Option C - Just take it to the register:**
- **You:** Sprawdzę przy kasie. Dziękuję. `(SPRAV-dzeh pshih KA-sheh. jen-KOO-yeh)` - I'll check at the register. Thank you.

---

## Complication 6: The Price Is Too High

**You find out it costs way more than expected.**

**Employee:** Trzydzieści złotych. `(tshih-JESH-chee ZWO-tih)` - Thirty złoty.
**You:** *Expected 10 zł*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Ask if that's right:**
- **You:** Trzydzieści? `(tshih-JESH-chee)` - Thirty? *surprised face*
- **You:** Na pewno? `(na PEV-no)` - For sure?

**Option B - Decline politely:**
- **You:** To za drogo. Dziękuję. `(to za DRO-go. jen-KOO-yeh)` - That's too expensive. Thank you.
- *Put it back*

**Option C - Ask for something cheaper:**
- **You:** Jest coś tańszego? `(yest tsosh TAN-she-go)` - Is there something cheaper?

- **Przy kasie (at the register)**: Common response. They're saying to ask at checkout.
- **Price tags are confusing**: Products often share shelf space. Look carefully at which tag matches which item.
- **No one judges your Polish**: They might seem impatient, but that's just Polish efficiency. Your effort is appreciated.
