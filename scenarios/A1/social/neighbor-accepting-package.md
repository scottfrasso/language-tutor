## Scenario: Package Handoff That Doesn't Go Smoothly

### Your Goal
Your neighbor received a package for you. But there might be: confusion about whose package it is, damage they're trying to explain, or something else you don't understand.

### Setting
Neighbor knocks on your door or stops you in hallway with a package. They need to communicate something about it.

## The Basic Exchange

**Neighbor:** Dzień dobry! Paczka dla pana/pani. `(jen DOB-rih! PACH-ka dla PA-na/PA-nee)` - Good day! Package for you.
**You:** O! Dziękuję! `(o! jen-KOO-yeh)` - Oh! Thank you!

*But sometimes it's more complicated...*

## Complication 1: They're Explaining Something You Don't Understand

**Neighbor is talking about the package - maybe damaged, maybe delayed, who knows.**

**Neighbor:** [Polish explanation about the package]

**Your options:**

**Option A - Just take it and thank:**
- **You:** Dziękuję bardzo! `(jen-KOO-yeh BAR-dzo)` - Thank you very much!
- *Sometimes you don't need to understand everything*

**Option B - Ask what they mean:**
- **You:** Przepraszam? `(psheh-PRA-sham)` - Sorry?
- **You:** Nie rozumiem. `(nyeh ro-ZOO-myem)` - I don't understand.

**Option C - Ask if there's a problem:**
- **You:** Jest problem? `(yest PRO-blem)` - Is there a problem?

## Complication 2: It's Not Your Package

**You look at the package. Wrong name or address.**

**You:** Przepraszam, to nie dla mnie. `(psheh-PRA-sham, to nyeh dla mnyeh)` - Sorry, this isn't for me.

**Or point to the label:**
- **You:** *Point at name* To nie ja. `(to nyeh ya)` - This isn't me.
- **You:** Inne nazwisko. `(EEN-ne naz-VEES-ko)` - Different name.

**Neighbor:** O, przepraszam! `(o, psheh-PRA-sham)` - Oh, sorry!

## Complication 3: Package Looks Damaged

**The box is crushed or opened. Neighbor is explaining.**

**Neighbor:** *Gestures at damage, speaks Polish*

**Your options:**

**Option A - Ask what happened:**
- **You:** Co się stało? `(tso sheh STA-wo)` - What happened?

**Option B - Accept it anyway:**
- **You:** Dobrze, dziękuję. `(DOB-zheh, jen-KOO-yeh)` - Okay, thanks.
- *You can deal with the courier later*

**Option C - Look confused:**

## Complication 4: Neighbor Seems Annoyed

**They've been holding this package for days. They seem irritated.**

**Neighbor:** *Annoyed tone* [Polish about waiting]

**Your recovery:**

- **You:** Przepraszam za kłopot. `(psheh-PRA-sham za KWO-pot)` - Sorry for the trouble.
- **You:** Dziękuję, że pan/pani trzymał/a. `(jen-KOO-yeh zheh pan/PA-nee tshih-MAW/wa)` - Thank you for holding it.

## Complication 5: It's for a Previous Tenant

**Neighbor:** *Points at name* To nie pan/pani?
**You:** *Look at name - not yours*

**Your response:**
- **You:** Nie, to nie ja. Stary lokator? `(nyeh, to nyeh ya. STA-rih lo-KA-tor)` - No, that's not me. Old tenant?
- **You:** Nie mieszkam tu długo. `(nyeh MYESH-kam too DWOO-go)` - I haven't lived here long.

**What to do:**
- You can refuse: "Przepraszam, nie mogę przyjąć."
