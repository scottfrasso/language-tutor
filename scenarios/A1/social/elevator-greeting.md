## Pronunciation Tips

1. **"Dzień dobry"**: jen DOB-rih. The "dz" sounds like "j" in "jeans"
2. **"Jak się"**: yak sheh. Quick and together
3. **"Pani" vs "Pan"**: PA-nee (woman), pan (man). Very important in formal situations!
4. **"Nawzajem"**: nav-ZA-yem. A useful word meaning "likewise"
5. **"Miłego"**: mee-WEH-go. The "ł" sounds like "w"

## Cultural Notes

- **Always greet in elevators**: In Poland, it's polite to greet people in elevators, especially in smaller apartment buildings where you see the same neighbors regularly.
- **Use formal address**: With older neighbors, always use "pan" (Mr./sir) or "pani" (Mrs./ma'am). It's more respectful.
- **Dzień dobry all day**: "Dzień dobry" is used from morning until evening. It's the safest, most common greeting.
- **Eye contact**: Make brief eye contact when greeting, but don't stare.
- **Keep it brief**: Elevator conversations are usually short. A simple greeting is enough.

---

## Common Complications

**What if they start speaking fast in Polish?**

- **You:** Przepraszam, nie rozumiem. `(psheh-PRA-sham, nyeh ro-ZOO-myem)` - Sorry, I don't understand.
- **You:** Uczę się polskiego. `(OO-cheh sheh pol-SKYE-go)` - I'm learning Polish.
- Most neighbors will be understanding and speak slower!

**What if you're not sure if it's a man or woman?**

- Just say: **You:** Dzień dobry `(jen DOB-rih)` without "pan" or "pani"
- This is safer if you're unsure!

**What if you see them multiple times a day?**

- First time: "Dzień dobry"
- Later the same day: Just a smile and nod is fine, or "Cześć" (informal "Hi")
