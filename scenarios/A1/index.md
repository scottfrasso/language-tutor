## Tips for A1 Learners

1. **Complications are normal**: Real conversations rarely go smoothly - practice handling problems
2. **Memorize survival phrases**: "Przepraszam" (Sorry), "Nie rozumiem" (I don't understand), "Wolniej" (Slower)
3. **Pronunciation matters**: Focus on the phonetic guides (CAPS = stress)
4. **Don't worry about mistakes**: Poles appreciate any attempt to speak Polish!
5. **"Przepraszam?" works for everything**: Use it when confused, to ask for repetition, or to get attention
